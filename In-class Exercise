(?<=\[)[\w\s]* --> everything between the []
(?<=\()[\S]*  --> everything between the () , none-white space char, but including the last ')'
(?<=\()[\S]*(?=\)) --> drop the last ')'

.+?(?=\s\|)  AND [\S]+(?=\s\|) does the same thing --> (look for links before the pipe)

(?<=\s\|\s).+ --> (everything after the pipe)
